#Compare the "like" word clouds for Trump and Obama (from lecture.) 
# Are there similarities/differences? What conclusions do you draw?

## Obama cloud
obama <- read_csv("~/Documents/Upenn/Data 410/Week 6/Lecture/obama_redacted_final.csv")
reasons <- Corpus(VectorSource(obama$reasontovote))
reasons <- tm_map(reasons, removeWords, stopwords('english'))
reasons <- tm_map(reasons, removePunctuation)
reasonsTDM <- TermDocumentMatrix(reasons) 
reasonsMT <- as.matrix(reasonsTDM) 
reasonsMT <- sort(rowSums(reasonsMT), decreasing = TRUE) 
reasonsDF <- data.frame(word = names(reasonsMT), freq = reasonsMT)
pal <- brewer.pal(6,"Dark2")
wordcloud(reasonsDF$word, freq= reasonsDF$freq, max.words = 100, 
              random.order = FALSE, colors = pal)

wordcloud(responseLtdata$word, freq=responseLtdata$freq, max.words = 100, random.order = F,
          colors = pal)
wordcloud(reasonsDF$word, freq= reasonsDF$freq, max.words = 100, 
          random.order = FALSE, colors = pal)

## Obama seemed to be more about ethos and a humancentric future, focusing on promise and hope
## while Trump has a power centric approach that feels very masculine. Ideals are also present here
## But they seem to be patriotic ideals. Where obama's message did not feel so gendered and
## rooted in patriotism.



# Compare the word clouds for Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton. Comment on your findings. 

# the like word clouds for Trump and Clinton
## The cloud for Hilary speaks really only to expierence and a litle about gender. The word Experience comes up
## as well as experienced and qualified and smart. For Trump we see alot more variety about business,
## economy and ethos.


wordcloud(responseLtdata$word, freq=responseLtdata$freq, max.words = 100, random.order = F,
          colors = pal)
wordcloud(responseLCdata$word, freq=responseLCdata$freq, max.words = 100, random.order = F,
          colors = pal)
## Dislikes
## The dislikes about clinton center about gender and honesty and her emails. Those are the largest
## and most common themes. In both instances, Hilary has a single theme and single idea driving 
## her likes and dislikes where trump is more varied in both.
## Conversly what people liked about Clinton, they did not like about Trump which makes sense. In trump's
## Word cloud 'lack' and 'expeirence' were central. As well as values about how he treats people. With people
## being a frequent word used as well as 'views' 'wall''racism'rude' ect.
