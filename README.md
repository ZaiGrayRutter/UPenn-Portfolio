# UPenn Portfolio
This repository hosts code samples from my post-baccalaureate at the University of Pennsylvania from 2020-2022. More information about the degree can be found <a href="https://lpsonline.sas.upenn.edu/academics/certificates/data-analytics">here.</a>

The projects published in this repository range from robust fundamentals to shiny apps, regression models and interactive maps. All code is written in R. PDFs are available as complement to the code.

## Quarter 1
This quarter features static map building and descriptive statistics. 

<strong> Week 6</strong> is a heat map of political outomces in elections in the United States. The code shows efficient merging and joining of several datasets.

<strong> Final Project</strong> is a much more complex series of descriptive statistics about 2012 senate elections in the United States.
## Quarter 2
This quarter ranges from strong fundamentals to statistical inference, regression models and stratified population samples.

<strong> Week 4</strong> shows data cleaning, merging and descriptive statistics reviewing corrleations between povery rates, college completion rates, and race.

<strong> Week 7</strong> This project examines if a treatment can increase voting outcomes among returned citizens (otherwise considered ex-felons). This project discusses research design and distinguishes how correlation claims can be made versus causal. This dataset also creates weights per population sample.

<strong> Midterm</strong> This midterm generates descriptive statistics from a poll about presidential preference between Trump and Clinton.
## Quarter 3
<strong> Week 1</strong> uses statistical analysis to find correlation. 

<strong> Week 3</strong> presents robust fundamental statistical analysis

<strong> Week 4</strong> uses statistical analysis to find correlation. 

<strong> Week 5</strong> uses statistical analysis to find correlation about college completion in low income familes.

<strong> Week 6</strong> moves towards advanced statistical analysis to find correlation about childhood poverty in low income familes.

<strong> Final Project</strong> Using the ANES dataset that polls hundreds of thousands of Americans on their opinions of political canddiates, I conduct my own investigation to see if individuals who work for the government have a higher approval rating of President Biden.

## Quarter 4

This quarter features advanced app building and interactive geospatial analysis using Shiny r and leaflet. 

<strong> App</strong> is a fully deployed website built from shiny R that examines school violence and test scores in Pennsylvania.

<strong> Week 3 and Week 2</strong> are deployed interactive maps.

<strong> Week 6</strong> using text analsyis from a survey without boolean operators to determine how a population feels towards a political canddiate.

<strong> Week 7</strong> robust SQL exploration.
